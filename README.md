## 1. Pattern Drawing in Python – Functions & OOP
**Description:**  
Creates a customizable square pattern using both a standalone function and an object-oriented class structure. Includes input validation, loop-based generation, and modular design for extending to other shapes. Demonstrates procedural programming, OOP, and clean code practices.

## 2. Debugging and Algorithm Optimization – Finding the Minimum Value
**Description:**  
Debugged and improved a function to find the smallest value in a list without using `min()`. Handles empty lists, avoids logic errors, and uses a robust, maintainable approach.
